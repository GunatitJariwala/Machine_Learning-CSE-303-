This repository contains all lab work, assignments, and practice notebooks created as part of the CSE-303: Machine Learning course.
It demonstrates core machine-learning algorithms, essential preprocessing techniques, and hands-on experiments on real datasets.

The notebooks are written in Python (Jupyter) and use popular ML libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.
